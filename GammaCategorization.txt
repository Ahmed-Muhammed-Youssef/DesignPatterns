Named after Erich Gamma, one of GoF
Design Patterns are split into three categories:
1. Creational Patterns
- Deal with th creation (construction) of objects
- Explicit (constructor) vs implicit(DI, reflection, etc.)
2. Structural Patterns
- Concerned with the structure (e.g. class members)
- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface.
- Stress the importance of good API design.
3. Behvioral Patterns
- They are all different; no centeral theme.
